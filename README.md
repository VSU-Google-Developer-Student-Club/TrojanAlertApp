## Problem Statement

Many universities have their own specific application available for download. These apps allow the user to receive tailored notifications regarding financial aid, social events, emergencies, etc.

Your task is to create a software that provides a notification system for VSU students. You shoulve have a process for specifying types of notifications and sending them ot the user, even when they are not using the software actively. For mobile apps, this may be push notifications. For web apps, this may be emails or browser notifications.

You should aim to have styling similar to VSU's colors.
